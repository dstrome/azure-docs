# How to use the Azure Location Based Services Map Control
The Map Control client-side Javascript library allows you to render maps and embedded Azure Location Based Services functionality into your web or mobile application. 

## Prerequisites
An Azure Location Based Services account and subscription key. For information on creating an account and retrieving a subscription key, see [How to manage your Azure Location Based Services account and keys](how-to-manage-account-keys.md). 

## Create a new map in a web page using the Map Control API
You can embed a map in a web page by using the Map Control client-side Javascript library.

1. Create a new file and name it MapSearch.html.

2. Add the Azure Location Based Services stylesheet and script source references to the `<head>` element of the file:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/css/atlas.min.css?api-version=1.0" type="text/css" />
    <script src="https://atlas.microsoft.com/sdk/js/atlas.min.js?api-version=1.0"></script>
    ```
    
3. In order to render a new map in your browser, add a **#map** reference in the `<style>` element.

    ```html
    #map {
                width: 100%;
                height: 100%;
            }
    ``` 
    
4. In order to initialize the map control, define a new section in the html body and create a script. Use your own subscription key from your Azure Location Based Services account. 

    ```html
    <div id="map">
        <script>
            var subscriptionKey = "<_subscriptionKey_>";
            var map = new atlas.Map("map", {
                "subscription-key": subscriptionKey,
                center: [47.59093,-122.33263],
                zoom: 12
            });
        <script>
    <div>
    ```
    
5. Open the file in your web browser and view the rendered map.
