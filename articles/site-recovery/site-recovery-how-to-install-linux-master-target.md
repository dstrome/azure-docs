# Install a Linux master target server
After you fail over your virtual machines, you can fail back the virtual machines to the on-premises site. To fail back, you need to reprotect the virtual machine from Azure to the on-premises site. For this process, you need an on-premises master target server to receive the traffic. 

If your protected virtual machine is a Windows virtual machine, then you need a Windows master target. For a Linux virtual machine, you need a Linux master target. Read the following steps to learn how to create and install a Linux master target.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with release of the 9.10.0 master target server, the latest master target server can be only installed on an Ubuntu 16.04 server. New installations aren't allowed on  CentOS6.6 servers. However, you can continue to upgrade your old master target servers by using the 9.10.0 version.

## Overview
This article provides instructions for how to install a Linux master target.

Post comments or questions at the end of this article or on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).

## Prerequisites

* To choose the host on which to deploy the master target, determine if the failback is going to be to an existing on-premises virtual machine or to a new virtual machine. 
	* For an existing virtual machine, the host of the master target should have access to the data stores of the virtual machine.
	* If the on-premises virtual machine does not exist, the failback virtual machine is created on the same host as the master target. You can choose any ESXi host to install the master target.
* The master target should be on a network that can communicate with the process server and the configuration server.
* The version of the master target must be equal to or earlier than the versions of the process server and the configuration server. For example, if the version of the configuration server is 9.4, the version of the master target can be 9.4 or 9.3 but not 9.5.
* The master target can only be a VMware virtual machine and not a physical server.

## Create the master target according to the sizing guidelines

Create the master target in accordance with the following sizing guidelines:
- **RAM**: 6 GB or more
- **OS disk size**: 100 GB or more (to install CentOS6.6)
- **Additional disk size for retention drive**: 1 TB
- **CPU cores**: 4 cores or more

The following supported Ubuntu kernels are supported.


|Kernel Series  |Support up to  |
|---------|---------|
|4.4      |4.4.0-81-generic         |
|4.8      |4.8.0-56-generic         |
|4.10     |4.10.0-24-generic        |

### Prepare the machine for configuration as a master target server
Next, prepare the machine for configuration as a master target server.

To get the ID for each SCSI hard disk in a Linux virtual machine,
 enable the **disk.EnableUUID = TRUE** parameter.

To enable this parameter, take the following steps:

1. Shut down your virtual machine.

2. Right-click the entry for the virtual machine in the left pane, and then select **Edit Settings**.

3. Select the **Options** tab.

4. In the left pane, select **Advanced** > **General**, and then select the **Configuration Parameters** button on the lower-right part of the screen.

	![Options tab](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/media/image20.png)

	The **Configuration Parameters** option is not available when the machine is running. To make this tab active, shut down the virtual machine.

5. See whether a row with **disk.EnableUUID** already exists.

	- If the value exists and is set to **False**, change the value to **True**. (The values are not case-sensitive.)

	- If the value exists and is set to **True**, select **Cancel**.

	- If the value does not exist, select **Add Row**.

	- In the name column, add **disk.EnableUUID**, and then set the value to **TRUE**.

	![Checking whether disk.EnableUUID already exists](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/media/image21.png)

#### Disable kernel upgrades

Azure Site Recovery master target server requires a specific version of the Ubuntu, ensure that the kernel upgrades are disabled for the virtual machine.

If kernel upgrades are enabled, then any regular upgrades cause the master target server to malfunction.

#### Download and install additional packages

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you have Internet connectivity to download and install additional packages. If you don't have Internet connectivity, you need to manually find these RPM packages and install them.

```
apt-get install -y multipath-tools lsscsi python-pyasn1 lvm2 kpartx
```

### Get the installer for setup

If your master target has Internet connectivity, you can use the following steps to download the installer. Otherwise, you can copy the installer from the process server and then install it.

#### Download the master target installation packages

[Download the latest Linux master target installation bits](https://aka.ms/latestlinuxmobsvc).

To download it by using Linux, type:

```
wget https://aka.ms/latestlinuxmobsvc -O latestlinuxmobsvc.tar.gz
```

Make sure that you download and unzip the installer in your home directory. If you unzip to **/usr/Local**, then the installation  fails.


#### Access the installer from the process server

1. On the process server, go to **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\home\svsystems\pushinstallsvc\repository**.

2. Copy the required installer file from the process server, and save it as **latestlinuxmobsvc.tar.gz** in your home directory.


### Apply custom configuration changes

To apply custom configuration changes, use the following steps:


1. Run the following command to untar the binary.
	```
	tar -zxvf latestlinuxmobsvc.tar.gz
	```
	![Screenshot of the command to run](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/image16.png)

2. Run the following command to give permission.
	```
	chmod 755 ./ApplyCustomChanges.sh
	```

3. Run the following command to run the script.
	```
	./ApplyCustomChanges.sh
	```
> [!NOTE]
> Run the script only once on the server. Shut down the server. Then restart the server after you add a disk, as described in the next section.

### Add a retention disk to the Linux master target virtual machine

Use the following steps to create a retention disk:

1. Attach a new 1-TB disk to the Linux master target virtual machine, and then start the machine.

2. Use the **multipath -ll** command to learn the multipath ID of the retention disk.

	```
	multipath -ll
	```
	![The multipath ID of the retention disk](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/media/image22.png)

3. Format the drive, and then create a file system on the new drive.

	```
	mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/<Retention disk's multipath id>
	```
	![Creating a file system on the drive](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/media/image23.png)

4. After you create the file system, mount the retention disk.
	```
	mkdir /mnt/retention
	mount /dev/mapper/<Retention disk's multipath id> /mnt/retention
	```
	![Mounting the retention disk](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/media/image24.png)

5. Create the **fstab** entry to mount the retention drive every time the system starts.
	```
	vi /etc/fstab
	```
	Select **Insert** to begin editing the file. Create a new line, and then insert the following text. Edit the disk multipath ID based on the highlighted multipath ID from the previous command.

	**/dev/mapper/<Retention disks multipath id> /mnt/retention ext4 rw 0 0**

	Select **Esc**, and then type **:wq** (write and quit) to close the editor window.

### Install the master target

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The version of the master target server must be equal to or earlier than the versions of the process server and the configuration server. If this condition is not met, reprotect succeeds, but replication fails.


> [!NOTE]
> Before you install the master target server, check that the **/etc/hosts** file on the virtual machine contains entries that map the local hostname to the IP addresses that are associated with all network adapters.

1. Copy the passphrase from **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\private\connection.passphrase** on the configuration server. Then save it as **passphrase.txt** in the same local directory by running the following command:

	```
	echo <passphrase> >passphrase.txt
	```
	Example: 
	
	```
	echo itUx70I47uxDuUVY >passphrase.txt
	```

2. Note the configuration server's IP address. You need it in the next step.

3. Run the following command to install the master target server and register the server with the configuration server.

 	```
	./install -q -d /usr/local/ASR -r MT -v VmWare
	/usr/local/ASR/Vx/bin/UnifiedAgentConfigurator.sh -i <ConfigurationServer IP Address> -P passphrase.txt
	```

	Example: 
	
	```
	/usr/local/ASR/Vx/bin/UnifiedAgentConfigurator.sh -i 104.40.75.37 -P passphrase.txt
	```

	Wait until the script finishes. If the master target registers sucessfully, the master target is listed on the **Site Recovery Infrastructure** page of the portal.


#### Install the master target by using interactive installation

1. Run the following command to install the master target. For the agent role, choose **Master Target**.

	```
	./install
	```

2. Choose the default location for installation, and then select **Enter** to continue.

	![Choosing a default location for installation of master target](./media/site-recovery-how-to-install-linux-master-target/image17.png)

After the installation has finished, register the configuration server by using the command line.

1. Note the IP address of the configuration server. You need it in the next step.

2. Run the following command to install the master target server and register the server with the configuration server.

	```
	./install -q -d /usr/local/ASR -r MT -v VmWare
	/usr/local/ASR/Vx/bin/UnifiedAgentConfigurator.sh -i <ConfigurationServer IP Address> -P passphrase.txt
	```
	Example: 

	```
	/usr/local/ASR/Vx/bin/UnifiedAgentConfigurator.sh -i 104.40.75.37 -P passphrase.txt
	```

   Wait until the script finishes. If the master target is registered successfully, the master target is listed on the **Site Recovery Infrastructure** page of the portal.


### Upgrade the master target

Run the installer. It automatically detects that the agent is installed on the master target. To upgrade, select **Y**.  After the setup has been completed, check the version of the master target installed by using the following command:

	```
	cat /usr/local/.vx_version
	```

You can see that the **Version** field gives the version number of the master target.

### Install VMware tools on the master target server

You need to install VMware tools on the master target so that it can discover the data stores. If the tools are not installed, the reprotect screen isn't listed in the data stores. After installation of the VMware tools, you need to restart.

## Next steps
After the installation and registration of the master target has finished, you can see the master target appear on the **Master Target** section in **Site Recovery Infrastructure**, under the configuration server overview.

You can now proceed with [reprotection](site-recovery-how-to-reprotect.md), followed by failback.

## Common issues

* Make sure you do not turn on Storage vMotion on any management components such as a master target. If the master target moves after a successful reprotect, the virtual machine disks (VMDKs) cannot be detached. In this case, failback fails.

* The master target should not have any snapshots on the virtual machine. If there are snapshots, failback fails.

* Due to some custom NIC configurations at some customers, the network interface is disabled during startup, and the master target agent cannot initialize. Make sure that the following properties are correctly set. Check these properties in the Ethernet card file's /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*.
	* BOOTPROTO=dhcp
	* ONBOOT=yes
