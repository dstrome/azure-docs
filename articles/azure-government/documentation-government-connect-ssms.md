# Connect to Azure Government with SQL Server Management Studio 
To use SSMS with Azure Government, you need to specify Azure Government as the environment to connect to instead of Azure Public. 
To connect to SQL Servers in your Azure Government subscription, you must configure SSMS to connect to the Azure Government cloud. 

For general information on SSMS, [navigate to the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

## Setting up Azure SQL Server Firewall Rule
Before you connect to Azure Government from SSMS, you must **set up an Azure SQL Server Firewall rule** to allow your local IP address to access your Azure SQL Server. 

Follow the steps for "Manage Firewall rules using the Azure Portal" [here](../sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure.md#manage-firewall-rules-using-the-azure-portal). 

## Specifying Azure Government as the environment to connect to
1. Open SSMS and navigate to **Tools -> Options -> Azure Services:**

    >[!Note]
    >Notice that the server name ends with ".usgovcloudapi.net"
    >
