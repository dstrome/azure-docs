# Assessment calculations

[Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md) assesses on-premises workloads for migration to Azure. This article provides information about how assessments are calculated.



## Overview

An Azure Migrate assessment has three stages. Assessment starts with a suitability analysis, followed by performance-based sizing estimations, and lastly, a monthly cost estimation. A machine only moves along to a later stage if it passes the previous one. For example, if a machine fails the Azure suitability check, itâ€™s marked as unsuitable for Azure, and sizing and costing won't be calculated. 


## Azure suitability analysis

Machines that you want to migrate to Azure must meet Azure requirements and limitations. For example, if an on-premises VM disk is more than 4 TB, it can't be hosted on Azure. The Azure compliance checks are summarized in the following table. 

**Check** | **Details**
--- | ---
**Boot type** | The boot type of the guest OS disk must be BIOS, and not UEFI.
**Cores** | The number of cores in the machines must be equal to (or less than) the maximum number of cores (32) supported for an Azure VM.<br/><br/> If performance history is available, Azure Migrate considers the utilized cores for comparison. If a comfort factor is specified in the assessment settings, the number of utilized cores is multiplied by the comfort factor.<br/><br/> If there's no performance history, Azure Migrate uses the allocated cores, without applying the comfort factor.
**Memory** | The machine memory size must be equal to (or less than) the maximum memory (448 GB) allowed for an Azure VM. <br/><br/> If performance history is available, Azure Migrate considers the utilized memory for comparison. If a comfort factor is specified, the utilized memory is multiplied by the comfort factor.<br/><br/> If there's no history the allocated memory is used, without applying the comfort factor.<br/><br/> 
**Windows Server 2003-2008 R2** | 32-bit and 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides best effort support only.
**Windows Server 2008 R2 with all SPs** | 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides full support.
**Windows Server 2012 & all SPs** | 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides full support.
**Windows Server 2012 R2 & all SPs** | 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides full support.
**Windows Server 2016 & all SPs** | 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides full support.
**Windows Client 7 and later** | 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides support with Visual Studio subscription only.
**Linux** | 64-bit support.<br/><br/> Azure provides full support for these [operating systems](../virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros.md).
**Storage disk** | Allocated size of a disk must be 4 TB (4096 GB) or less.<br/><br/> The number of disks attached to the machine must be 65 or less, including the OS disk. 
**Networking** | A machine must have 32 or less NICs attached to it.


## Performance-based sizing

After a machine is marked as suitable for Azure, Azure Migrate maps it to a VM size in Azure, using the following criteria:

- **Storage check**: Azure Migrate tries to map every disk attached to the machine to a disk in Azure:
       - Azure Migrate multiplies the I/O per second (IOPS) by the comfort factor. It also multiples the throughput ( in MBps) of each disk by the comfort factor. This provides the effective disk IOPS and throughput. Based on this, Azure Migrate maps the disk to a standard or premium disk in Azure.
    - If the service can't find a disk with the required IOPS & throughput, it marks the machine as unsuitable for Azure.
    - If it finds a set of suitable disks, Azure Migrate selects the ones that support the storage redundancy method, and the location specified in the assessment settings.
    - If there are multiple eligible disks, it selects the one with the lowest cost.
- **Storage disk throughput**: [Learn more](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md#storage-limits) about Azure limits per disk and VM.
- **Disk type**: Azure Migrate supports managed disks only.
- **Network check**: Azure Migrate tries to find an Azure VM that can support the number of NICs on the on-premises machine.
    - To do this, it aggregates the data transmitted per second (MBps) out of the machine (network out) across all NICs, and applies the comfort factor to the aggregated number. This number if used to find an Azure VM that can support the required network performance.
    - Azure Migrate takes the network settings from the VM, and assumes it to be a network outside the datacenter.
    - If no network performance data is available, only the NIC count is considered for VM sizing.
- **Compute check**: After storage and network requirements are calculated, Azure Migrate considers compute
requirements:
    - If the performance data is available for the VM, it looks at the utilized cores and memory, and applies the comfort factor. Based on that number, it tries to find a suitable VM size in Azure.
    - If no suitable size is found, the machine is marked as unsuitable for Azure.
    - If a suitable size is found, Azure Migrate applies the storage and networking calculations. It then applies location and pricing tier settings, for the final VM size recommendation.


## Monthly cost estimation

After sizing recommendations are complete, Azure Migrate calculates post-migration compute and storage costs.

- **Compute cost**: Using the recommended Azure VM size, Azure Migrate uses the Billing API to calculate
the monthly cost for the VM. The calculation takes the operating system, software assurance, location, and currency settings into account. It aggregates the cost across all machines, to calculate the total monthly compute cost.
- **Storage cost**: The monthly storage cost for a machine is calculated by aggregating the monthly cost of
all disks attached to the machine. Azure Migrate calculates the total monthly storage costs by aggregating the storage costs of all machines. Currently, the calculation doesn't take offers specified in the assessment settings into account.

Costs are displayed in the currency specified in the assessment settings.
