# Group machines for assessment

This article describes how to create a group of machines for assessment by [Azure Migrate](migrate-overview.md). Azure Migrate assesses machines in the group to check whether they're suitable for migration to Azure, and provides sizing and cost estimations for running the machine in Azure.


## Create a group

1. In the **Dashboard** of the Azure Migrate project, click **Groups** > **+Group**, and specify a group name.
2. Add one or more machines to the group, and click **Create**. 
3. You can optionally select to run a new assessment for the group.

After the group is created, you can modify it by selecting the group on the **Groups** page, and adding or removing machines.
