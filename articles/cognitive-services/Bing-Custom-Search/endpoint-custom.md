# Custom Search endpoint

The **Custom Search API**  includes one endpoint, which returns results from the Web based on a [user-defined set](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search/tutorials/custom-search-web-page) of sources. 

##Endpoint
To get results using the Bing Custom Search API, send a `GET` request to the following endpoint. Use the headers and URL parameters to define further specifications.

Endpoint `GET`:
```  
https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bingcustomsearch/v7.0/search  
```
Returns search suggestions as JSON results that are relevant to the user's input defined by `?q=""`.


For examples that describe how to set up Custom Search sources, see the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-custom-search/tutorials/custom-search-web-page). For details about headers, parameters, market codes, response objects, errors, etc., see the [Bing Custom Search API v7](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-custom-search-api-v7-reference) reference.

##Response JSON
The response to a videos search request includes results as JSON objects. 

##Next steps
The **Bing** APIs support search actions that return results according to their type. All search endpoints return results as JSON response objects.  All endpoints support queries that return a specific language and/or location by longitude, latitude, and search radius.

For complete information about the parameters supported by each endpoint, see the reference pages for each type.
