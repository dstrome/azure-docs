# Region availability for Azure Container Instances

During preview, Azure Container Instances are available in the following regions with the specified CPU and memory limits.

| Location | OS | CPU | Memory (GB) |
| -------- | -- | :---: | :-----------: |
| West Europe, West US, East US | Linux | 2 | 7 |
| West Europe, West US, East US | Windows | 2 | 3.5 |

## Resource availability

Container instances created within these resource limits are subject to availability within the deployment region. When a region is under heavy load, you may experience a failure when deploying instances.

To mitigate such a deployment failure, try deploying instances with lower CPU and memory settings, or try your deployment at a later time.
