# Deploy to Azure Container Instances from the Azure Container Registry

The Azure Container Registry is an Azure-based, private registry, for Docker container images. This article covers how to deploy container images stored in the Azure Container Registry to Azure Container Instances.

## Using the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI includes commands for creating and managing containers in Azure Container Instances. If you specify a private image in the `create` command, you can also specify the image registry password required to authenticate with the container registry.

```azurecli-interactive
az container create --name myprivatecontainer --image mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/mycontainerimage:v1 --registry-password myRegistryPassword --resource-group myresourcegroup
```

The `create` command also supports specifying the `registry-login-server` and `registry-username`. However, the login server for the Azure Container Registry is always *registryname*.azurecr.io and the default username is *registryname*, so these values are inferred from the image name if not explicitly provided.

## Using an Azure Resource Manager template

You can specify the properties of your Azure Container Registry in an Azure Resource Manager template by including the `imageRegistryCredentials` property in the container group definition:

```json
"imageRegistryCredentials": [
  {
    "server": "imageRegistryLoginServer",
    "username": "imageRegistryUsername",
    "password": "imageRegistryPassword"
  }
]
```

To avoid storing your container registry password directly in the template, we recommend that you store it as a secret in [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli2.md) and reference it in the template using the [native integration between the Azure Resource Manager and Key Vault](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-keyvault-parameter.md).

## Using the Azure portal

If you maintain container images in the Azure Container Registry, you can easily create a container in Azure Container Instances using the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your container registry.

2. Choose Repositories.

    ![The Azure Container Registry menu in the Azure portal][acr-menu]

3. Choose the repository that you want to deploy from.

4. Right-click the tag for the container image you want to deploy.

5. Enter a name for the container and a name for the resource group. You can also change the default values if you wish.

    ![Create menu for Azure Container Instances][acr-create-deeplink]

6. Once the deployment completes, you can navigate to the container group from the notifications pane to find its IP address and other properties.
