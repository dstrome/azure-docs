# Use cloud-init to update and install packages in a Linux VM in Azure
This article shows you how to use [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io) to update packages on a Linux virtual machine (VM) or virtual machine scale sets (VMSS) at provisioning time in Azure. These cloud-init scripts run on first boot once the resources have been provisioned by Azure. For more information about how cloud-init works natively in Azure and the supported Linux distros, see [cloud-init overview](using-cloud-init.md)

## Update a VM with cloud-init
For security purposes, you may want to configure a VM to apply the latest updates on first boot. As cloud-init works across different Linux distros, there is no need to specify `apt` or `yum` for the package manager. Instead, you define `package_upgrade` and let the cloud-init process determine the appropriate mechanism for the distro in use. This workflow allows you to use the same cloud-init scripts across distros.

To see upgrade process in action, create a file in your current shell named *cloud_init_upgrade.txt* and paste the following configuration. For this example, create the file in the Cloud Shell not on your local machine. You can use any editor you wish. Enter `sensible-editor cloud_init_upgrade.txt` to create the file and see a list of available editors. Choose #1 to use the **nano** editor. Make sure that the whole cloud-init file is copied correctly, especially the first line.  

```yaml
#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
packages:
- httpd
```

Before deploying this image, you need to create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. The following example creates a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* location.

```azurecli-interactive 
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Now, create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create) and specify the cloud-init file with `--custom-data cloud_init_upgrade.txt` as follows:

```azurecli-interactive 
az vm create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name centos74 \
  --image OpenLogic:CentOS:7-CI:latest \
  --custom-data cloud_init_upgrade.txt \
  --generate-ssh-keys 
```

SSH to the public IP address of your VM shown in the output from the preceding command. Enter your own **publicIpAddress** as follows:

```bash
ssh <publicIpAddress>
```

Run the package management tool and check for updates. The following example uses `apt-get` on an Ubuntu VM:

```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

As cloud-init checked for and installed updates on boot, there should be no updates to apply, as shown in the following example output:

```bash
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Calculating upgrade... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

You can also view that `httpd` was installed by running `yum history` and review the output referencing `httpd`.
