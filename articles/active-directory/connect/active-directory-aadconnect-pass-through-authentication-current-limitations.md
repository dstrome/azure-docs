# Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication: Current limitations

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Pass-through Authentication is a free feature, and you don't need any paid editions of Azure AD to use it. Pass-through Authentication is only available in the world-wide instance of Azure AD, and not on the [Microsoft Azure Germany cloud](http://www.microsoft.de/cloud-deutschland) or the [Microsoft Azure Government cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/gov/).

## Supported scenarios

The following scenarios are fully supported:

- User sign-ins to all web browser-based applications
- User sign-ins to Office 365 client applications that support [modern authentication](https://aka.ms/modernauthga)
- Office 2016, and Office 2013 _with_ modern authentication
- Azure AD domain joins for Windows 10 devices
- Exchange ActiveSync support

## Unsupported scenarios

The following scenarios are _not_ supported:

- User sign-ins to legacy Office client applications: Office 2010, and Office 2013 _without_ modern authentication. Organizations are encouraged to switch to modern authentication, if possible. Modern authentication allows for Pass-through Authentication support. It also helps you secure your user accounts by using [conditional access](../active-directory-conditional-access-azure-portal.md) features, such as Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.
- User sign-ins to Skype for Business client applications, including Skype for Business 2016.
- User sign-ins to PowerShell version 1.0. We recommended that you use PowerShell version 2.0.
- Azure Active Directory Domain Services.
- App passwords for Multi-Factor Authentication.
- Detection of users with [leaked credentials](../active-directory-reporting-risk-events.md#leaked-credentials).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>As a workaround for unsupported scenarios _only_, enable password hash synchronization on the [Optional features](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md#optional-features) page in the Azure AD Connect wizard.

>[!NOTE]
Enabling password hash synchronization gives you the option to failover authentication if your on-premises infrastructure is disrupted. This failover from Pass-through Authentication to Active Directory password hash synchronization is not automatic. You'll need to switch the sign-in method manually using Azure AD Connect. If the server running Azure AD Connect goes down, you'll require help from Microsoft Support to turn off Pass-through Authentication.
