## <a name="rest"></a>Deploy using REST APIs 
 
You can use the [deployment service REST APIs](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/REST-API) to deploy the .zip file to your app in Azure. Just send a POST request to `https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/zipdeploy` that contains the .zip file in the message body. The deployment credentials for your app are provided in the request using HTTP BASIC authentication. For more information, see the [.zip push deployment reference topic](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/wiki/Deploying-from-a-zip-file). 

The following example uses the cURL tool to send a request that contains the .zip file. You can run cURL from the terminal on a Mac or Linux computer or using Bash on Windows. Replace the `<zip_file_path>` placeholder with the path to the location of your project .zip file. Also replace `<app_name>` with the unique name of your app.

Replace the `<deployment_user>` placeholder with the username of your deployment credentials. When prompted by cURL, type in the password. To learn how to set deployment credentials for your app, see [Set and reset user-level credentials](../articles/app-service/app-service-deployment-credentials.md#userscope).   

```bash
curl POST -u <deployment_user> --data-binary @"<zip_file_path>" https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/zipdeploy
```

This request triggers push deployment from the uploaded .zip file. You can review the current and past deployments using the `https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/deployments` endpoint, as shown in the following cURL example. Again, replace replace `<app_name>` with the name of your app and `<deployment_user>` with the username of your deployment credentials.

```bash
curl -u <deployment_user> https://<app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/deployments
```
