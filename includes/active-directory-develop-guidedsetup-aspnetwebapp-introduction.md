# Add sign-in with Microsoft to an ASP.NET web app

This guide demonstrates how to implement sign-in with Microsoft using an ASP.NET MVC solution with a traditional web browser-based application using OpenID Connect. 

At the end of this guide, your application will be able to accept sign ins of personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that has integrated with Azure Active Directory.

## How this guide works

![How this guide works](media/active-directory-develop-guidedsetup-aspnetwebapp-intro/aspnetbrowsergeneral.png)

This guide is based on the scenario where a browser accesses an ASP.NET web site, requesting a user to authenticate via a sign-in button. In this scenario, most of the work to render the web page occurs on the server side.
